    <p>hi, i'm farseen. i build things on the internet.</p>

    <p>25, based in hubli, india. fullstack developer focused on ai tooling and streaming infrastructure.</p>

    <p>my path here wasn't linear. struggled through school, scraped into engineering college, spent the first two years figuring out what i actually wanted to do. eventually found programming - started with python, fell in love with web dev, and haven't stopped building since.</p>

    <p>worked a couple of jobs that taught me what i didn't want. that clarity pushed me into freelancing, where i shipped projects for clients, made mistakes, and learned what actually matters - shipping quality work, on time.</p>

    <p>now i'm building open-source tools:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/farseenmanekhan1232/win-set">win-set</a> - very minimal and opinionated window manager for macos with hyprland-style auto-tiling</li>
        <li><a href="https://rynk.io">rynk.io</a> - ai research platform on cloudflare's edge with semantic search</li>
        <li><a href="https://neustream.app">neustream.app</a> - multi-platform streaming infrastructure, open-source alternative to restream</li>
        <li><a href="https://xtraspare.com">xtraspare</a> - e-commerce marketplace handling 10k+ products</li>
    </ul>

    <p>also built <a href="https://github.com/farseenmanekhan1232/tkeybr">tkeybr</a> (terminal-based typing tutor inspired by keybr.com) and fixed a long-standing auth issue in <a href="https://github.com/farseenmanekhan1232/cf-tool">cf-tool</a> (codeforces cli) by building a companion chrome extension.</p>

    <p>i work with typescript, react, next.js, node, postgresql, cloudflare workers, and ai/ml tools like openai, langchain, and vector databases. also deep into streaming tech - webrtc, mediasoup, ffmpeg.</p>

    <p>everything i build is open-source. check out my <a href="https://github.com/farseenmanekhan1232">github</a>.</p>
